# Medical Image Analyzer(MIA) Project
- Analyzing Chest Radiography(CR) images utilizing Pytorch and OpenCV, with insights from relevant research papers.
## Dataset Description
- BIMCV-COVID19+ dataset is a large dataset with chest X-ray images CXR (CR, DX) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19 patients along with their radiographic findings, pathologies, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) diagnostic antibody tests and radiographic reports from Medical Imaging Databank in Valencian Region Medical Image Bank (BIMCV).
- The findings are mapped onto standard Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) terminology and they cover a wide spectrum of thoracic entities, contrasting with the much more reduced number of entities annotated in previous datasets.
- Images are stored in high resolution and entities are localized with anatomical labels in a Medical Imaging Data Structure (MIDS) format.
- In addition, 23 images were annotated by a team of expert radiologists to include semantic segmentation of radiographic findings.
- Moreover, extensive information is provided, including the patientâ€™s demographic information, type of projection and acquisition parameters for the imaging study, among others.
- These iterations of the database include 21342 CR, 34829 DX and 7918 CT studies.
