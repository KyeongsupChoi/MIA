# Dataset Description

BIMCV-COVID19+ dataset is a large dataset with chest X-ray images CXR (CR, DX) and computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19
patients along with their radiographic findings, pathologies, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
and immunoglobulin M (IgM) diagnostic antibody tests and radiographic reports from Medical Imaging Databank in
Valencian Region Medical Image Bank (BIMCV). The findings are mapped onto standard Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) 
terminology and they cover a wide spectrum of thoracic entities, contrasting with the much more reduced number of entities 
annotated in previous datasets. Images are stored in high resolution and entities are localized with anatomical labels in a
Medical Imaging Data Structure (MIDS) format. In addition, 23 images were annotated by a team of expert radiologists to include 
semantic segmentation of radiographic findings. Moreover, extensive information is provided, including the patient’s 
demographic information, type of projection and acquisition parameters for the imaging study, among others.
These iterations of the database include 21342 CR, 34829 DX and 7918 CT studies.
