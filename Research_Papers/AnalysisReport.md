## Summary

- Timely and accurate interpretation of chest radiographs obtained to evaluate endotracheal tube (ETT) position is important for facilitating prompt adjustment if needed.

- The purpose of thi study was to evaluate the performance of a (DL)-based artificial intelligence (AI) system for detecting ETT presence and position on chest radiographs.

- This retrospective study included 539 chest radiographs obtained immediately after ETT insertion from January 1 to March 31, 2020, in 505 patients (293 men, 212 women; mean age, 63 years) from institution A (sample A); 637 chest radiographs obtained from January 1 to January 3, 2020, in 302 patients (157 men, 145 women; mean age, 66 years) in the ICU (with or without an ETT) from institution A (sample B);
and 546 chest radiographs obtained from January 1 to January 20, 2020, in 83 patients
(54 men, 29 women; mean age, 70 years) in the ICU (with or without an ETT) from institution B (sample C). 

- A commercial DL-based AI system was used to identify ETT presence and measure ETT tip-to-carina distance (TCD). 

- The reference standard for proper ETT position was TCD between greater than 3 cm and less than 7 cm, determined by human
readers. 

- Critical ETT position was separately defined as ETT tip below the carina or TCD
of 1 cm or less. 

- AI had sensitivity and specificity for identification of ETT presence of 100.0% and 98.7% (sample B) and 99.2% and 94.5% (sample C). 

- AI had sensitivity and specificity for identification of improper ETT position of 72.5% and 92.0% (sample A),
78.9% and 100.0% (sample B), and 83.7% and 99.1% (sample C). 

- At a threshold y-axis TCD of 2 cm or less, AI had sensitivity and specificity for critical ETT position of 100.0% and 96.7% (sample A), 100.0% and 100.0% (sample B), and 100.0% and 99.2% (sample C).

- AI identified improperly positioned ETTs on chest radiographs obtained after ETT insertion as well as on chest radiographs obtained of patients in the ICU at two institutions.

- Automated AI identification of improper ETT position on chest
radiographs may allow earlier repositioning and thereby reduce complications.

## Thoughts

- Improper ETT placement had the most glaring low sensitivity(73%-84), meaning the AI could not detect some cases. 

- More or better reference points and inclusion of other factors such as angle of ETT could improve sensitivity.

## Summary

- This study aimed to investigate the clinical implications and prognostic value of (AI)-based results for chest radiographs (CXR) in COVID-19 patients. 

- A commercial AI-based software(Lunit INSIGHT CXR, version 3) was used to assess CXR data for consolidation and pleural effusion scores.

- Clinical data, including laboratory results, were analyzed for possible prognostic factors. Total O2 supply period, the last SpO2 result, and deterioration were evaluated as prognostic indicators of treatment outcome. 

- Generalized linear mixed model and regression tests were used to examine the prognostic value of CXR results. 

- Among a total of 228 patients, consolidation scores had a significant association with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein changes. 

- Initial consolidation scores were associated with the last SpO2 result (estimate −0.018, p = 0.024). 

- All consolidation scores during admission showed significant association with the total O2 supply period and the last SpO2 result.

- Early changing degree of consolidation score showed an association with deterioration (odds ratio 1.017, 95% confidence interval 1.005–1.03). 

- In conclusion, AI-based CXR results for consolidation have potential prognostic value for predicting treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

- Overfitting has been a major obstacle to the actual clinical application of AI algorithms.

- Pleural effusion score did not show significant results.

## Thoughts

- Diverse data sources could potentially address overfitting.

- Patients lacking followup exams was a weakpoint in the data.

- AI was a component in this study, but the fact that there were patterns between patient factors, means an AI for prognosis could potentially be developed.

## Summary

- The study evaluates a deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for detecting and localizing three major thoracic abnormalities visible on chest radiographs (CRs).
- A subset of 244 subjects, with 60% having abnormal CRs, was analyzed. 
- The performance of physicians with and without the assistance of the algorithm was compared using observer performance tests.
- The algorithm demonstrated high accuracy in detecting abnormalities, with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) values of 0.9883 for nodules/mass, 1.000 for consolidation, and 0.9997 for pneumothorax. 
- When physicians were assisted by the algorithm, their overall performance in image classification and lesion detection improved, as indicated by higher AUC values and a weighted jackknife alternative free-response ROC (wJAFROC) figure of merit (FOM). 
- Specifically, the overall AUC for image classification increased from 0.8679 without the CAD algorithm to 0.9112 with it, and the wJAFROC FOM for lesion detection improved from 0.8426 to 0.9112.
- These findings suggest that the deep learning-based CAD algorithm can enhance physicians' performance in detecting major thoracic abnormalities on chest radiographs.
- CAD systems powered by artificial intelligence have shown promise in improving the detection and measurement of various diseases, including breast cancer, brain tumors, liver lesions, vessel borders, and blood flow dynamics. 
- In the realm of thoracic diseases, automated detection algorithms have been developed for conditions like tuberculosis, as well as for distinguishing between normal and abnormal chest radiographs. 
- A DL algorithm  used in this study was designed to classify chest radiographs of patients with 3 major abnormal findings, including nodule/mass, consolidation, and pneumothorax, and enhance the performance of human readers.
- Board-certified radiologists 0.9313 (0.9097–0.9529) 0.9586 (0.9399–0.9730) 
Non-radiology physicians 0.9153 (0.8917–0.9389) 0.9440 (0.9425–0.9747)
General practitioners 0.7686 (0.7311–0.8062) 0.8940 (0.8663–0.9218)

## Thoughts

- General practitioners benefited most from CADs

- Utilize different data such as patient blood pH, blood cell count, age to enhance diagnosis accuracy?

- Use opacity for lower areas for project
