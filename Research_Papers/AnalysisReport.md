## Summary

- The study evaluates a deep learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for detecting and localizing three major thoracic abnormalities visible on chest radiographs (CRs).
- A subset of 244 subjects, with 60% having abnormal CRs, was analyzed. 
- The performance of physicians with and without the assistance of the algorithm was compared using observer performance tests.
- The algorithm demonstrated high accuracy in detecting abnormalities, with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) values of 0.9883 for nodules/mass, 1.000 for consolidation, and 0.9997 for pneumothorax. 
- When physicians were assisted by the algorithm, their overall performance in image classification and lesion detection improved, as indicated by higher AUC values and a weighted jackknife alternative free-response ROC (wJAFROC) figure of merit (FOM). 
- Specifically, the overall AUC for image classification increased from 0.8679 without the CAD algorithm to 0.9112 with it, and the wJAFROC FOM for lesion detection improved from 0.8426 to 0.9112.
- These findings suggest that the deep learning-based CAD algorithm can enhance physicians' performance in detecting major thoracic abnormalities on chest radiographs.
- CAD systems powered by artificial intelligence have shown promise in improving the detection and measurement of various diseases, including breast cancer, brain tumors, liver lesions, vessel borders, and blood flow dynamics. 
- In the realm of thoracic diseases, automated detection algorithms have been developed for conditions like tuberculosis, as well as for distinguishing between normal and abnormal chest radiographs. 
- A DL algorithm  used in this study was designed to classify chest radiographs of patients with 3 major abnormal findings, including nodule/mass, consolidation, and pneumothorax, and enhance the performance of human readers.
- Board-certified radiologists 0.9313 (0.9097–0.9529) 0.9586 (0.9399–0.9730) 
Non-radiology physicians 0.9153 (0.8917–0.9389) 0.9440 (0.9425–0.9747)
General practitioners 0.7686 (0.7311–0.8062) 0.8940 (0.8663–0.9218)

## Thoughts

- General practitioners benefited most

- Utilize different data such as patient blood pH, blood cell count, age to enhance diagnosis accuracy?
